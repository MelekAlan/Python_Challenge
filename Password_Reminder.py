Task: 

Let's say; you left a message in the past that prints a password you need. To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you. Write a program that

Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,

Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",

If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."


Solution:

name = "Melek"
password = "abc123"
name_i = input("Please enter your name : ").title().strip()

if name_i == name :
  print("Hello {}!Your password is : {}".format(name, password))
else :
  print("Hello, {}! See you later".format(name_i))
